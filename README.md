## Tech Stack Overview

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.

- **Three.js**: A cross-browser JavaScript library and API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.

- **Framer Motion**: A production-ready motion library for React that makes it easy to create fluid animations and interactive UI elements.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid custom designs directly in your markup.

Each of these technologies plays a crucial role in creating a modern, performant, and visually appealing web application.
